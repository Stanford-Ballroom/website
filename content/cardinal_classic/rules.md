### Events
Individual events are offered in American style, International style, and Nightclub dances. All events are open to leaders and followers of any gender. Two or more dances separated by a slash constitute a multi-dance event. Contestants in multi-dance events will be judged collectively in all listed dances. Contestants in International style categories must dance International style, and contestants in American style categories must dance American style.

Competitors should be ready to dance at least 30 minutes before their scheduled event.

The decisions of the Invigilator and Head Judge shall be final.


### Eligibility

Events are open to all amateur competitors. Although the event is collegiate in nature, competitors do not have to be students and there are no age restrictions for any events.

Professional dancers are not allowed to compete in any event at Cardinal Classic. An individual will be considered a Professional and ineligible for competition if they have ever done any of the following:

- Registering as a Professional with any dance association (such as NDCA, USADance, ISTD, etc)
- Competing as a Professional
- Declaring themself as a Professional by word or deed
- Have solicited or received monetary compensation from a partner for competing at any collegiate Ballroom Dance competition

Specific questions about eligibility should be directed to [cardinal-classic@ballroom.stanford.edu](mailto:cardinal-classic@ballroom.stanford.edu).


### Shoe Policy

The Stanford Ballroom club shoe policy requires that all dancers wear shoes that will not mark or damage the floor. Suede-soled dance shoes are strongly encouraged. Heel protectors are required for high-heeled shoes. Competitors may not apply powder or oil to the floor or to the soles of their shoes.

### Costumes

Costumes are not allowed in Newcomer or Bronze level, but are allowed in Silver and above, Rookie/Veteran, and all nightclub levels. We follow the [CDA Costume Guidelines](https://collegiatedancesport.org/costumes/) which consider the following items to be costumes:

- Jackets of any kind, including tail suits, tuxedo jackets, and off-the-rack suit jackets.
- Floats, streamers, scarves, cords hanging from sleeves, sashes, or any other non- structural material that flows behind while a dancer is in motion.
- Shirts or tops that are open to below the breastbone.
- Skirts or dresses with more than two layers in the skirting.
- Any article of clothing incorporating rhinestones, gemstones, sequins, or actual lights. (“Articles of clothing” include shirts, pants, vests, skirts, socks, ties, pocket squares, belts, suspenders, etc. Jewelry items are not considered articles of clothing and may include stoning, etc. These include: rings, necklaces, belt buckles, tie pins & clips, bracelets, earrings, other piercings, hairpieces, cufflinks, watches, and lapel pins. For this year's event, face masks will also be considered jewelry items and may include stoning, etc, provided the integrity and function of the mask is unaffected.)
- The heavy use of feathering, glitter, metallic fabric, metallic threading, and related decorative effects constitute a costume when more than 10% (cumulative) of the area of the article of clothing is covered by these effects.
- The heavy use of fringing constitutes a costume when more than 25% of the total area of all clothing is covered by fringe.
- Shoes are excluded from these costume guidelines since they present an unavoidable expense regardless of their appearance. Nevertheless, dancers are expected to honor the spirit of costuming restrictions and not augment (e.g. add stoning to) shoes for levels of competition in which costuming restrictions apply.

Costume violations will typically require correction before allowing dancers to participate, which may result in missing an event.

If you have questions about a particular item of clothing, please e-mail your question along with photos of the clothing item to [cardinal-classic@ballroom.stanford.edu](mailto:cardinal-classic@ballroom.stanford.edu).

### Levels

American and International style events are offered in Newcomer through Open levels. Please read and understand the eligibility guidelines below and choose your level accordingly. Eligibility restrictions will be enforced in all levels. Couples in violation of eligibility rules may be moved to a higher level or disqualified without advance notice.

Both dancers in a couple must individually be eligible to dance at any given level. In the Standard, Smooth, Rhythm and Latin categories, couples may enter the lowest level for which both dancers are eligible, and the next higher level for each dance. (For example, a Bronze level dancer may also enter Silver level events.) A competitor may not enter in more than two consecutive levels in any dance. In the Nightclub category, a competitor may only enter one level (Newcomer/Beginner OR Intermediate/Advanced) for each dance.

As mentioned below, Newcomer, Bronze, Silver and Gold levels are closed syllabus events. For International-style events, syllabus restrictions refer to the ISTD Specified Figures, at the Associate level for the Bronze, through the Fellow level for Gold. For American-style events, any published syllabus (Fred Astaire, Arthur Murray, DVIDA, ISTD) may be used. ISTD step lists for International and American styles are available from http://www.usistd.org/. The head judge or designated invigilator will strictly invigilate syllabus events. Syllabus violations may result in a warning, lower placement, or disqualification from placement, as determined by the head judge.

No lifts, drops, or aerials are allowed in any event at this competition.

The Mustang Ball is a CDA Fair Level competition and will use fair level points to determine when couples are entered in a level that is too low for their calculated proficiency. You can look up your fair level points using the Fair Level Point Lookup Tool. Dancers who do not have fair level points should refer to the guidelines below to determine their appropriate level.

#### Newcomer

Newcomer events are open to couples where both partners started Ballroom Dancing less than a year ago (after February 7, 2025.) Costumes are not permitted, and only Bronze syllabus choreography may be danced.

#### Bronze

Bronze events are for beginning dancers relatively inexperienced with ballroom dance competitions. Costumes are not permitted, and only Bronze syllabus choreography may be danced.

#### Silver

Silver events are for dancers with competitive experience. Those taking intermediate level classes and dancing regularly should find this category appropriate. Bronze and Silver syllabus figures can be used and costumes are optional.

#### Gold

Gold events are for more experienced competitors. Costumes are permitted, and any syllabus choreography (Bronze, Silver, or Gold) may be used.

#### Novice, Pre-Champ, Championship

Novice, Pre-Champ, and Championship are advanced levels are for experienced competitors and are equivalent to the corresponding level at USADance/NDCA competitions. Competitors who have placed out of Gold or Pre-Novice level are only eligible for Novice or higher. Costumes are strongly encouraged, and there are no restrictions on choreography.

#### Rookie/Veteran

Think of this level (also called Mixed Proficiency) as being similar to a Pro/Am event, but with an experienced Amateur instead of a Pro. The rules are as follows:

- The Rookie partner must qualify as a newcomer dancer (less than a year of competitive experience and not pointed out of newcomer)
- If the Rookie partner is also dancing in regular proficiency events in that style, it may only be at the newcomer, newcomer/bronze or bronze/silver level and cannot be with the same partner as Rookie/Veteran.
- The Veteran partner must be a silver level dancer or higher in that style, meaning they cannot be competing at the Bronze level in that style.
- Both partners must be amateur dancers.
- Choreography is strictly restricted to Bronze syllabus only
- Only the Rookie dancer will be judged.
- There are no costume restrictions.
- The events will be held after the Gold level events in each style.
- The events will be all single dance events (no multi-dance).
- The Rookie/Veteran dances will be:

| Style     |         |         |         |                 |            |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Smooth    | Waltz   | Tango   | Foxtrot | Viennese Waltz  |            |
| Standard  | Waltz   | Tango   | Foxtrot | Viennese Waltz  | Quickstep  |
| Rhythm    | ChaCha  | Rumba   | Swing   | Bolero          | Mambo      |
| Latin     | ChaCha  | Rumba   | Samba   | Paso Doble      | Jive       |



#### Nightclub

Nightclub events are open to all competitors and carry no restrictions on costumes or choreography. However, lifts, drops, and aerials are not permitted in any event. The nightclub events have been separated into two-level categories: Beginner, for couples with little to no competitive experience (less than 2 years total competitive experience); and Intermediate/Advanced, for couples with more competitive experience. You may only sign up for one level for each nightclub dance.
